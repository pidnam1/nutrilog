# Nutrilog

# A web app which helps those located in food deserts manage healthy shopping
# Nutrilog scans a handwritten or typed grocery list and returns the nutritional value of all the items on the list, as well as possible alternatives to the item if it is not available, as is common in food deserts. 

# Working demo of the app can be found at nutrilog2021.herokuapp.com
