# Nutrilog

# A web app which helps those located in food deserts manage healthy shopping
# Nutrilog scans a handwritten or typed grocery list and returns the nutritional value of all the items on the list, as well as possible alternatives to the item if it is not available, as is common in food deserts. The alternative options suggested are close in nutrional value to the original items, in order to help people in food deserts cope with possible lack of access to their first options. 

# Working demo of the app can be found at nutrilog2021.herokuapp.com, demo found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW9Dx3_AI7k&t=94s
